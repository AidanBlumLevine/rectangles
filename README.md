# rectangles

Recursive subdivision of a rectangle to create procedurally generated art. This was inspired by [this](https://generated.space/sketch/ballots-client/) work by Kjetil Golid.

Orthagonal 3D rendering is performed entirely in the canvas (no webGL), using the [painter's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm)

Images can be customized, generated, and downloaded from the site below.
